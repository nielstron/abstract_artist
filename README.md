# Abstract Artist

This project is an attempt at simulating the drawing process of abstract modern arts.

## How do I use this?

Download and execute the executable.
Promising values have been 1000 px Size and 1000 Strokes.

## How do I build this myself?

Set up an OpenCV installation on your computer (I will not go into the details, descriptions are to be found in the interenet). 
Include the cpp file in your projects folder.



Disclaimer: I personally love abstract art but could not ignore the similarity between produced works and popular abstract art.
